![list design](./assets/influencer_list_design.png)

For this coding test, we’d like you to build out the above interface as a React application.

The app should allow a user to view their list of ‘Starred’ influencers. This list should be sortable, and it should be possible to remove a user from the list.

The app should also show a list of suggested influencers. Clicking on these users should add them to the starred influencer list.

You should:

* Use React.
* Use a state management system (we use Redux).
* Demonstrate handling data through API calls. Faking this is fine for the purposes of this demonstration.
* Allow the user to sort the list.
* Stick to the above design as much as possible.
