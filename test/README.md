### Development Approach

I used the Test Driven Development approach to build this app. I first focussed on testing and building the redux side, before working on testing and building the components. Styling came last, give and take a few minor adjustments to the app at the end, such as holding the sort order as state in the StarredList component.

A working version of this app has been hosted on github pages at <https://lizziem2003.github.io/model-village/>.
